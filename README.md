Twinkle
=======

Twinkle is a JavaScript library and application that gives Wikipedians a quick way of performing common maintenance tasks, such as nominating pages for deletion and cleaning up vandalism.

It is based upon the `morebits.js` library, which forms the basis for many Wikipedia scripts and editing tools.

See [Wikipedia:Twinkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle) on English Wikipedia for more information.

[AzaToth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AzaToth) is the original author and maintainer of the tool, as well as the `morebits.js` library.
